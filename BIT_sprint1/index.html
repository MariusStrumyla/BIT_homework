<h1>Few words about me</h1>
<p>Hey there,<br>
my name is Marius, I'm from Lithuania and currently I'm a student on Baltic Institute of Technology studying Full stack. Before these courses I was serving in military and I have spend around 8 and a half years in there. IT sector was on my mind for a long time, probably for too long so I decided to make a move. It was hard in the beggining but leaving military and chasing my dream felt like a fresh wind on my yard.</p>

    <section>
        This blog was created as a first project for a grade while I'm studying Full stack here in Lithuania. At first I did not took it for a serious thing but then I thought I'm going to make it as real as I can and who knows maybe I will start writing in.<br>
        Before these studies I was trying to learn Front-end from sources like SoloLearn, youtube tutorials and freecodecamp.org. I know it sounds great but it wasn't like that in reality. The progress was slow because I was working on two different jobs and had to find atleast some time for my family and especially my Little one. It was hard to do so. I had to choose my priorities and most of the time it had to be work so I was not happy about that. I wanted more free time, flexible hours, to create some kind of a product others could see, to be able to work from home and ofcourse to be able to earn more.<br>
        So I decided I needed a change. Every time I had an oppurtunity I was taking my laptop out of my backpack and started learning but IT is a whole different sector than military so my brain were boiling - like for real! It was like that because I havent done anything like that for years so my brain needed to adapt. After some time I got more knowledge about Front-end, mostly Html and Css but progress have stoped. I was stuck on tutorials thinking "I'm not ready yet, I dont know everything yet", because of that it was hard to try writing code by myself so then I stopped. I needed time to think and get a plan since I made a decision I'm going to leave military for better. I started searching and found courses that had to start in like a month and a half, I even had an opportunity to get funded so I used the opportunity and here I am. Now I'm not working so I', using that time for studies.<br>
        Hope you havent slept, do you?<br>
        So I hope you already understood that this blog is for you - yes, you who are struggling there. I know you will break out of these chains that are holding you, doesnt matter what kind of chains those are.
        Good vibes only.
